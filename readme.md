# Endless-Wiki-Viewer

Static JavaScript Frontend-only app using Wikipedia API to create an endless scroll page of random Wikipeida articles.
Articles can be viewed within the app.
Articles can be saved to localstorage only as this is a Frontend app only.

I build this using bootstrap 4 and mostly vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to learn how to make AJAX requests as well as to improve my DOM manipulation/navigation with event delegation...
